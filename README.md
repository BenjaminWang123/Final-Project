Data and Audience

Our Data Set - Predict students' dropout and academic success


What is the dataset you’ll be working with? Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.

The data set we will be working with is college student data that takes in multiple variables to predict whether the student will be likely to drop out or graduate, and if they stay in school will they be successful or not. The creator of this data set goes by The Devastator (Owner) and our project team accessed this data from Kaggle. The collectors of this data state that they collected this data because there is a great demand for dropout/success rate college predictor data and because so many data sets include data from similar institutions and define dropout differently, it's hard to compare dropout rates between institutions with that data. So the collectors wanted to create data that compared students from across different institutions, but still collected the same variables to compare and all have one definition of ‘dropout’. 

Who is your target audience? Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should home in on one of these audiences.

Our target audience who will utilize this data is university administration, more specifically, people who deal with admissions and people who assist students who are more likely to drop out.

What does your audience want to learn from your data? Please list out at least 3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.


Does the student's current debt and status of their tuition bill play a role in whether they will drop out or not? Do these students have scholarships or not?
Does Previous qualification have any association to dropout rate? When considering this question also asking: does students previous qualification have anything to do with their economic status (debtor)?
Do the qualifications and occupations of the students' mother and father play a role in student success rate?


Technical Description
This section of your proposal asks you to think through the specific analytical steps you’ll need to complete throughout the project.

How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?

We are going to process our date in CSV file

What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?

By doing data analysis, we may first clean our data set to make sure there’s no unreasonable data. Then, we are going to operate data by utilizing some common methods such as select, filter and etc.

What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)

We are going to use common libraries.

What questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?

How to predict the success rate of students with different social-economic condition

What major challenges do you anticipate?

How to find the most related factors which related to students’ academic success

Project Set-up

In addition to outlining the steps you’ll be taking to complete the project, you’ll also be setting up your project on GitHub by doing the following:

Create a public repository on GitHub in which you’ll be completing your final projects. All group members should be added to the repo so they can push directly to it
https://github.com/ArthurWangN/Final-Project.git Here is the public repository I created for the group project. 
Here is the public repository for the final project. 

Create 5 GitHub Issues as your first set of steps to take in the project. You should assign these to individual group members to complete
The five issues have all been posted.
	
Optional: Create a slack/discord/… channel for your group to use for communication.
